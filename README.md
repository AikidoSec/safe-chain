# Aikido Safe Chain

The Aikido Safe Chain **prevents developers from installing malware** on their workstations through npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, pnpx, and bun.

The Aikido Safe Chain wraps around the [npm cli](https://github.com/npm/cli), [npx](https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/latest/docs/content/commands/npx.md), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [pnpx](https://pnpm.io/cli/dlx), and [bun](https://bun.sh/) to provide extra checks before installing new packages. This tool will detect when a package contains malware and prompt you to exit, preventing npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, pnpx, or bun from downloading or running the malware.

Aikido Safe Chain works on Node.js version 18 and above and supports the following package managers:

- ‚úÖ **npm**
- ‚úÖ **npx**
- ‚úÖ **yarn**
- ‚úÖ **pnpm**
- ‚úÖ **pnpx**
- ‚úÖ **bun**

# Usage

## Installation

### For npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, pnpx

Installing the Aikido Safe Chain is easy. You just need 3 simple steps:

1. **Install the Aikido Safe Chain package globally** using npm:
   ```shell
   npm install -g @aikidosec/safe-chain
   ```
2. **Setup the shell integration** by running:
   ```shell
   safe-chain setup
   ```
3. **‚ùóRestart your terminal** to start using the Aikido Safe Chain.
   - This step is crucial as it ensures that the shell aliases for npm, npx, yarn, pnpm and pnpx are loaded correctly. If you do not restart your terminal, the aliases will not be available.
4. **Verify the installation** by running:
   ```shell
   npm install safe-chain-test
   ```
   - The output should show that Aikido Safe Chain is blocking the installation of this package as it is flagged as malware.

When running `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `pnpm` or `pnpx` commands, the Aikido Safe Chain will automatically check for malware in the packages you are trying to install. If any malware is detected, it will prompt you to exit the command.

### For bun

Bun uses a different integration approach and **does not require shell integration**:

1. **Install the Aikido Safe Chain package globally**:

   ```shell
   bun add -g @aikidosec/safe-chain
   ```

2. **Configure Bun security scanner** by creating a `bunfig.toml` file:

   **Option A: Global (recommended)** - Create in your home directory (`~/bunfig.toml`):

   ```toml
   [install.security]
   scanner = "@aikidosec/safe-chain"
   ```

   **Option B: Project-level** - Create in your project root:

   ```toml
   [install.security]
   scanner = "@aikidosec/safe-chain"
   ```

3. **Verify Bun integration** by running:
   ```shell
   bun add safe-chain-test
   ```
   The output should show that Aikido Safe Chain is blocking the installation of this package as it is flagged as malware.

**Note**: Unlike other package managers, Bun users do **not** need to run `safe-chain setup` or restart their terminal, as Bun uses its native security scanner API instead of shell aliases.

## How it works

The Aikido Safe Chain works by intercepting package manager commands and verifying packages against **[Aikido Intel - Open Sources Threat Intelligence](https://intel.aikido.dev/?tab=malware)**.

**For npm, npx, yarn, pnpm and pnpx**, the Aikido Safe Chain integrates with your shell to provide a seamless experience. It sets up aliases for these commands so that they are wrapped by the Aikido Safe Chain commands, which perform malware checks before executing the original commands.We currently support:

- ‚úÖ **Bash**
- ‚úÖ **Zsh**
- ‚úÖ **Fish**
- ‚úÖ **PowerShell**
- ‚úÖ **PowerShell Core**

More information about the shell integration can be found in the [shell integration documentation](docs/shell-integration.md).

**For Bun**, it uses Bun's native security scanner API to integrate directly into the package installation process.

## Uninstallation

### For npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, pnpx

To uninstall the Aikido Safe Chain:

1. **Remove all aliases from your shell** by running:
   ```shell
   safe-chain teardown
   ```
2. **Uninstall the Aikido Safe Chain package** using npm:
   ```shell
   npm uninstall -g @aikidosec/safe-chain
   ```
3. **‚ùóRestart your terminal** to remove the aliases.

### For Bun

To uninstall for Bun users:

1. **Remove the scanner configuration** by deleting the `[install.security]` section from your `bunfig.toml` file (either in your project root or `~/bunfig.toml`)
2. **Uninstall the Aikido Safe Chain package**:
   ```shell
   bun remove -g @aikidosec/safe-chain
   ```
